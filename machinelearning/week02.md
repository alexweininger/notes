# Week 2 Notes

Model, what is a model?

- structure
- equation
- function
- approximate measurements

y = failure (product)
    model     data

J = y delta y^ (difference between prediction and real)

y = mx + b

if you make a 3d graph of the error vs b and m
then the lowest point on that graph is the best model

y = mx + b (take the derivative with respect to b and m)

to prevent the slope car from getting stuck in a valley that is not the lowest, add some randomness

# regression
