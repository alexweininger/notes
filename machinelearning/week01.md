# Week 1 Notes

The singularity will never happen because we are not building machines that are going towards human intelligence. These machines are built for a single, super specific, task.

What is learning?

We all have some model, a mental understanding of things. Artifacts are used to augment or change that model. The artifacts are the data points that we can then learn and create a model from.

In data science we will be building a model, and we will use the data as our measured artifact to augment the model.

Definition:

> _"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programming."_ - Arthur Samuel, famous for programming a computer to play checkers. The first use of machine learning.

Why ML and Why now?

* progress in algorithms and computational power
* flood of data
* problems are matched by algorithms and data and power. We now have all three.

Applications at a glance

* SW engineering data driven
* Data mining
	* historical data to improve predictions
	* classifies medical images -> new images -> new predictions
* SW engineering
	* cannot encode all cases as if/then/else
	* NLP, speech processing, autonomous systems, self driving cars
* continuous performance improvement based on new data
	* more data, better predictions
	* summarizers

Symbolic vs. continuous data

symbolic: not changing, clearly defined

continuous: rule based systems, a picture, EEG
