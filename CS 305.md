CS 305 Notes

**Ch 1.**
High Level vs Low Level:
	-A low level refers to the basic, primitive parts of something. Groups of these make up the high level
	-High level refers to something that makes sense of these low level parts into something bigger
	-Ex. Computer’s microchips/microcircuits vs the computer itself; car nuts and bolts vs the engine

Black box: “a simple unit behaving in predictable ways”; ex. Engine, car is a group of black boxes

Advantages of C Programming Language:
	-Access to any level on the computer, including raw machine language
	-C is very simple and compact; balance simplicity and readability
	-Interacts with local environment well
	-Allows commands that in other languages aren’t allowed; by being careful, this allows much more freedom in coding

**Ch 2**
Compiler: Translates high level language into machine language from a text doc, called the “source code”; this allows the computer to understand what needs to be done and executed
Run C Program: 
- ./nameOfProgram; “dot-slash” prefix
- Looks into current directory
Compile C Program:
- In GNU environments using the GCC(GNU Compiler Collection)
- “gcc file_name”

Note: C programs are case sensitive
Errors:
- Compile error: errors caught while compiling, such as something misspelled or an error in the formatting (missing bracket, etc.)
- Run-time error: Error occurs while program is running(infinite loop, wrong outcome)

Source code names “accounts” >> accounts.c
Executable file >> accounts

To run this program, we would use ./accounts

**Ch 3**
Block: A section of code within a function; in the main() function, the end of it means the end of the program (Usually) while other functions transfer control back to the main or whatever function called it;
-C Programs start whereever the main() function starts; this could be line 1 or line 100
-“ } “ signifies the end of a function
- “ ; “ is used like in Java
- */ and /* are used to create comments

**Ch 4**
-Funcitons are blocks performing specific tasks; they make a section of code reusable
-Function in C must have a name beginning with a letter or ‘_’ character
 
```c
Void multiply_two_numbers(int a, int b){
	Int c;
	c = a * b
	printf(“%d/n”, c);  	//%d specifies integer output
```

A function needs to return value of the same type; if it is type void, however, it should not return anything. 
Functions should have their return type declared at the beginning of the code in a global sense (prototype) and actually defined somewhere in the code
exit(0)- Terminates the programs anywhere in the code; returns 0

**Ch 5**
-C has 5 types of integers: char, short, int, long, long long
-Difference is how much memory is saved for each
-char is used only in arrays; variables should use int data type

Example variable declarations in C:
- float temp1, temp2, temp3;
- int initial_year;
- initial_year = 1969;

Cast operator: (type) variable; converts one variable type to another
Storage classes: extern and static; extern makes variables globally accessible, static makes variables the same across all instances of a function
- auto: redundant but essentially the opposite of static
- register: store in one of computer’s register
Practice:
int start_temp, end_temp;
float and double differentiate in their precision
int covers both + and – while unsigned int only covers +
float num = 23.1256
int num_integer = (int)num

¬**Ch 6**
Global vs local: global variables are visible to the entire program while local is kept within a function; global is defined outside of functions, after the #include

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int global_integer
```

Global vars are available anywhere, anytime, and anywhere in the program until the program stops running
Communication via parameters: local variables can communicate with other variables via the parameters of a function

**Ch 7**
-Operand: character/string of characters that operates on one or more values to produce a result
int remainder = 5/2;
printf(“%d/n”, remainder)

10 – (-5)

**Ch 8**
Paramaters can be passed by value or by reference:
- Value parameters: one-way information; only the values are received and these values cannot be altered
- Variable parameters: pass information back to the calling function; these values can be altered

 In the prototype function(function defined at top of code), it’s good practice to include parameter variable names
	-function(int var1) vs function(int)

Actual parameter: parameter called by function
Formal parameter: temporary name for parameter used in function declarations

Passing by reference allows you to change the original parameter as opposed to just altering the passed value(if var1 = 1 the altering var1 instead of just 1)
A function call can be used as an actual parameter if it fits the data type
-actual and formal parameters don’t need to share the same names
**Ch 9**
Pointer: has the address or location of a chunk of memory; “point to a chunk of memory”
- Pointers allow to pass by reference(passing address instead of value)
- Pointers also work with functions
- Make C very versatile in alternating between value and reference

Pointers are created using ‘  *‘ and ‘ & ‘ operators;*  is used to declare
- Float *total_cost_ptr (read “Declare a float pointer called var name)
While & finds the address, used as so:
- Total_cost_prt = &total_cost (Pointer now points to address of total_cost)

Pointer types: depending on the data type, you can define a pointer to point to an address of a specific data type; it will automatically cast it to the type the pointer is; use when you need a float address to be an integer (use int pointer to find float address to cast as int)
Cast by doing (type *) pointer_variable

*Pointers should not be initialized with a value; it can be done but it wastes memory and space	 
Because the return command can only pass back one value, pointers become more useful through passing reference by allowing multiple values to be changed

When pointers are called in a function:
- Declared: get_values(int *numptr1, int* numptr2)
- Called: get_values(&num1, &num2)
Review:
Pointers are variables that reference the address of another variable that has a data value
Variables are declared to be pointers using *
Pointers will autocast different data types; careful when doing this
Int *int_ptr = (double* ) int_ptr
Float *number = 2.65; don’t do this because it’s essentially wasting date; pointers can not have values, even though it doesn’t do anything to the program

**Ch 10**
If…else… statement review; same as java

‘ ? ‘ operator: (condition) ? expression1 : expression2
- Evaluates conditions; expression1 returns if true and expression2 if false
Switch statement: 
```c
switch (integer or character expression)
	case constant1 : statement1;
	break;

if(1 != 42){
	printf(“Thank heavens for math!”)
}
```



**Ch 11**

Review over while, do-while, and for loops; same as Java
In while loops, can initiate a value to a variable if wrapped with parentheses 
For loops can include empty statements; if both the initialization and increment are left out, we’re left with while loop essentially
Break- breaks a loop
Return- breaks a loop in a function
Continue-automatically goes to end of loop to start another loop

Kal: 2.1-2.8
- Review over what pointers are and how to initialize
Initialize multiple pointers:
- int *a, b, c 		//wrong; b and c are just ints
- int *a,* b, *c	//right; all are now int pointers

- and & essentially cancel each other out so:
- *ptr =* (&num) is just num
	-Additionally: num = *ptr + 1 >> num = num + 1 or even (*ptr)++

When a function parameter is set as a pointer formally, we pass through the address of the desired value which allows the function to directly and globally change the value the given address or variable.
In addition if a pointer is set to the address of a variable (ptr = &num) and is passed through, it will only refer to the value at the address the pointer is pointing too. This is why we pass through the &num and not ptr.

Arrays: Passing arrays as arguments is the same as passing the address of the first array index point
list is the same as &list[0] if list is an array
Because it is only the first index point, array names are not pointer variables, they are pointer constants.
Character pointers: If a char pointer is declared and set to a string, it will be assigned to the address of the first character; this can be changed but then the first address assigned will be in accessible
Pointer arithmetic: 
- char *verse = “The day is done��;
- Stored somewhere, verse is assigned to address of ‘T’
- Verse + 1 is address of ‘h’
- Verse + 2 is address of ‘e’
- Verse++ and verse += h are also valid
- Incrementing a pointer means finding the next data type address, regardless of how many bytes 	
Pointers to Structures- fun6(text), pointer to a structure variable of type Book is passing by value. Additionally, fun7(&text) also helps avoid extra processing while achieving the same function. Finally, we add a formal parameter void fun7(Book *bp).
In other words, Structure* var_name can create a pointer referring to the address of a structure/object. 
We can also use a more common method in C, due to frequency of pointers to structures:
	Sp -> name
Pointers to functions: Function names are actually pointers themselves, as arrays are pointers to themselves. We would, however, need pointers if we want to pass a function as a parameter, such as making a table but having a double value that could either be division, reciprocal, etc.
Ex. double(*fp)(int)

Void pointers- Can point to any type of object or function( void *pv vs. void* getNode(int size); Even though void pointers can point to any type, it cannot be dereferenced because its type is void; we can do this however, if we know the data type
- (double*) pv

**Ch 14**
Arrays: Grouping of same type variables under a single name; up to three dimensionality
Practice:
Double array- double double_array[4][5] = {1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,…
Since arrays are pointers, C can just reference the address when an array is passed through as a parameter to a function

**Ch 15**
Strings: Sequence of text characters to be a string variable
-Strings can be any size/length, but it’s size is determined by the position of the first null character, denoted by ‘/0’ in the string; most C programs add/remove it automatically
-To declare a String, we need to make a character array
	Ex. char string1[] = “A string declared as an array.\n”; 	//Best way to do so; null character added automatically
	Ex. char *string2 = “A string declared as a pointer.\n”	//This also works
	Ex. char string3[30];		//Use when actual string data is unknown but there’s a general idea of how long it will be(name, location, essay, etc.)

String Arrays: When an array of text is needed, we need a string array, not just separate char arrays. Initialize like so:
```c
Char *menu[] =
{
    “string”,
    “string1”,
    “string2”,
…
};
```
-Combines methods 1 and 2 of creating a String to make a string array

String library functions:
atof: converts string to float value
atoi: converts string to int
atol: long
strcat: concatenates two strings
strcmp: compares two strings and returns which one comes first alphabetically; returns 0 if same values or if first string comes first; returns -1 if seconds string comes first
strcpy: copies a string into a string variable
strlen: length of string in characters
strncat: concatenates a specified numbers of characters
strncmp: certain number of characters compared
strncpy: certain number copied
strstr: sees if a substring is located in a larger string

**Kal 3.3**
Dynamic Storage Allocation: malloc, calloc, sizeof, free
-When creating list of values, arrays are to the go to; however, one disadvantage is the size must be determined beforehand
-Linked list allows new nodes to be added and storage allocated for it
-Linked list are referred to “dynamic storage allocation” due to adding storage as needed while array is seen as “static” storage
malloc- ex. void *malloc(size_t size) where size_t is a undefined type of int; malloc allocates memory and will return a pointer to first byte of this memory; the difference is it will not initialize the memory;
Lecture 9/3/18
Static memory is pre-allocated for different programs, files, OS, etc.; 
Dynamic allocated memory is know as a “heap”; free storage that can be used by any program; before closing a program, the memory taken from the “heap” from the OS must be returned to the OS
malloc- allocated a specified size of bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte; not initialized and returns null if no storage available; declared as follows:
```c
char *cp = (char *)malloc(20);
//Programmer should be keeping track of types and storage management
//calloc-  allocates memory for an array of values that are a certain size; following //is the prototype:
void *calloc(size_t num, size_t size);
char *cp = calloc(10, 20);
//Useful for allocating storage for arrays
//Sizeof- finds needed bytes for storing its argument; 
	Ex. sizeof(int)		//returns 4
```
Used for portable code, where the amount of bytes used is different, such as 2 for an int on one and 4 on another. Used alongside malloc and calloc:
	Double *dp = (double*) malloc(sizeof(double));
free- used to free storage used/taken up through malloc or calloc functions;
	free(void *ptr) ex. free(np)
**Ch 19**
C allows various data types and to create your own, but there are some that are implemented into C already
enum- “enumerated data”; a list of words that a variable of type enum can take as its value; 
ex.
int main()
{
	enum compass_direction{
		north,
		east,
		south,
		west,
	}
enum compass_direction my_direction;
my_direction = west;
return 0;
}
-Prevents computer from having to process numbers and instead focus on words themselves; higher-level method; enums match alongside switch statements; enums are useful for their simplicity and ability to make words into integer values in terms of comparison
void- main function is to have functions that return no value; simply have a return command and the function will end;
While void variables are useless, void pointers are generic, meaning they can be assigned to any pointer; you can also cast other pointer types as void and the info will not be affected
volatile- permits use of “memory-mapped variables”, which are variables that change based on the state of the hardware, such as a temperature value; help code run more efficiently rather than optimizing the best possible case
constants- declared with const qualifies; must be assigned a value when declared
constant expressions- string or numeric value put directly into C code; 
What is the difference between constant and constant expression?
#define MY_LONG1 23L; 	//Long value
Declare hexadecimal with prefix 0x or octal with 0
-Int my_hex_integer = 0xFF or int my_octal_integer = 077
You can also print values with \x for hexadecimal or \ for octal
struct and union- (Ch 20)
typedef- this command allows you to define your own data types; the format is as follows:
		typedef existing_type new_type; //ex. typedef int my_type
Mostly used for renaming structures and unions, as their names can be long and tedious. Seldom do we rename existing data types to create our own type.
**Ch 20**
Data Structures- Manipulating becomes difficult if they are not organized together, which is why C groups data together using packages, or data structures
struct- a type of data structure, that groups variables together under a common name; as opposed to arrays, it can contain different types of data and can even have arrays; variables under a struct are called “members”
union- same as struct but only one at a time; it can be linked with a struct using lists and trees (complex data structures)
Data structure is generically referring to patterns of data and groups, while struct is a specific C data type that groups variables together; a structs are data structures but not vice versa.

Structure declarations:
```c
struct personal_data
{
	char name[100];
	char address[200];
	int year_of_birth;
	int month_of_birth;
}
-Different structures can have members with the same name
-Once declared, we can declare variables of this data type (struct personal_data person0001)
-typedef can be used to declare it at the start of the program to make it easier to declare variables
typedef struct{
	variables….
}personal_data
```
-Structures are powerful, they are parameters, values, and can be assigned to other structures; (structure_name.member_name) is used to call member values; also structs can be assigned to each other like person1 = person2 and the members will be passed over
struct arrays- arrays are declared in the usual way, by adding [length] to the end of the variable declaration
nested structures- basically we can put a structure type within another structure type
Pointers to structures- structs can hold pointers pointing to themselves as well as other similar structs; invaluable for building linked lists and trees; 
	Declaration: struct personal_data *my_struct_ptr;
	(*my_struct_ptr).day_of_birth = 23;
Another operator to use a pointer is using ‘->’ like so
	my_struct_ptr->day_of_birth = 23;
‘->’ allows direct access to the structs members
Memory allocation- Most variables have a fixed size (static) but some will need to be dynamic with the program; size can vary on this data and is created through memory allocation using the malloc function and resized with realloc; the former takes one parameter the size, the latter takes two, pointer to the memory block and the new size; both return void; use free to free up any memory allocated
For struct, we can use the sizeOf method to find the size needed for a struct
union- struct where all members can be stored at the same address but only one member can move at a time; prevents fragmentation where it breaks up its memory into inefficiently sized chunks; creates standard size for all specific data
Declaration of unions:
```c
union int_or_float{
	int int_member;
	float float_member;
};	//Similar to struct
//Remember, a union can only be one data type at a time
//enums can be used to keep track of what data type is stored for each member
enum which_number{
	INT,
	FLOAT,
};	//Uppercase letters to prevent from causing an error by calling key words

//A switch statement can be used to handle union members:
union int_or_float my_union1;
enum which_member my_union_status1;

switch(my_union_status1){
	case INT:
		my_union1.int_member += 5;
		break;
	case FLOAT:..
…
}
```
Complex data structures- 
**Kal 1.1-1.10**
Structure: collection of one or more variables; contains various data types depeding on what the struct represents, such as a student or a bank account; allow more efficient organization of data

```c
//Declare a sturcture
struct date {int day, month, year}; //or
struct date {
    int day, month, year
};
```

We can picture the blocks as so:

             day          month        year
dob|                |                |                |

To access the variables, we would use '.' with the class; %[reference type]

*Note: #include <time.h> is a structure for time and date among other things

typeded: give a name to an existing type; the name of this new defined type is synonymous with the type it is referenced to; we can use it especially to rename what structs are to make it easier to code/type in the program:
```c
//typedef examples
typedef int Whole;    //Whole is now a new type that acts the same as an int
Whole amount, copies;    //Declaring variables of type Whole, which is the same as declaring as type int
//Ideally, this allows declaring structs much easier and cleaner, so when declaring structs, you can use typedef to make it cleaner everytime
typedef struct date{
    int day, month, year;
}Date;
Date borrowed, returned
```

struct arrays can be declared the same way as other arrays (ex. struct student[100])

-*Note: when storing value, data, etc. for an array, be sure not to go out of bounds and store data in memory not within the array's bounds; this will cause an issue with the memory

Searching an array of structs just requires you to use a for loop to find instances of the given argument

Sorting an array by name example:
```c
void sort(Student list[], int n){
//sort list[0] to list[n-1] by name using an insertion sort
    Student templ
    int k;
    for(int h = 1; h < n; h++){
        Student temp = list[h];
        k = k - 1;
        while(k >= - && strcmp(temp.name, list[k].name) < 0){
            list[k + 1] = list[k];
            k = k - 1;
        }
    }
}//end sort
```

#include <string.h> -- Includes string functions such as .strcmp and .strcpy

Nested Structs: Using a struct to be a part of the definiting of another struct; similar to inheritance
```c
//Using dob struct and new Student struct
typedef struct{
    char name[31];
    Date dob;
    char gender;
}Student;
```
