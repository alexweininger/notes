# The Clean Coder

Unit tests:

Written by programmers, for programmers, in the programming language of the system. Should be as close to 100% coverage as possible.

Component tests:

Part of acceptance tests, written against individual components in the system. These encapsulate the business rules. A component test wraps around a component, it inputs data and gathers output data. Testing the validity of the output. Other system components are decoupled from the test using appropriate mocking and test doubling techniques.

Written by QA and business with assistance from developers.
