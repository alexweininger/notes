# Testing
## Test Driven Development

Writing unit tests before writing the code

1. Write the test first

- forces the developer to understand the required behavior of the new code

2. run the test and watch it fail

- no code yet but it tests the tests itself

3. write the minimum amount of code that is needed to pass the test

## Agile

**regression testing**

**agile testing** is a style of testing one with lessened reliance on documentation, increased acceptance of change, and the notion that a project is on ongoing conversation about quality

- business facing: described in terms of business people and describe non-technical issues
- technology facing: one that you describe with words that programmers would understand

- support programming: test the code to make sure what we changed did not create any unexpected behavior
- critique the product:

Unit testing:
- white box testing: clarity
- allows QA team to focus less on code bugs and more on system level testing

Component testing: short of a feature, but it is a feature from a technical level.
- unit testing may be uses for testing components
- http unit or XML unit

Use case vs. scenario:
-scenario is a whole user's story with the product, made up of multiple use cases

Story acceptance testing
