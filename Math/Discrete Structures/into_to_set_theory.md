# Intro to Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of objects called **elements**.

A set containing no elements is called an **empty set**.

You can define a set using **builder notation**:

`S = {x E A: x satisfies some condition}`

If A and B are sets, A is a **subset** of B, provided that every element of A is also an element of B.
