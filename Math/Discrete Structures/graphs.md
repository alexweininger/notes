# Graph theory

## Definitions

A **walk** is a sequence of edges of a graph.

A **trail** is a distinct set of edges.

A **path** is a trail with distinct vertices.

To be **closed** means that the starting vertex is also the ending vertex.

A closed trail is called a **circuit**.

A closed path is called a **cycle**.

A graph is a **simple graph** if it has no repeated edges and no loops. Versus a multigraph.

A **separating set** of a graph is a set of vertices that disconnect the graph.

When a separating set only contains one vertex, this vertex is called a **cut-vertex**.

If deleting an edge disconnects a graph this edge is a **bridge**.

A set of edges that disconnect a graph is called a **disconnecting set**.

A minimal disconnecting set is called a **cutset**.

## Theorems

The sum of the degree of all the vertices of a graph is always even.

Any graph has an even number of odd degree vertices.

For a connected graph G, deleting any edge disconnects G if and only if G has no circuits.
