## 1.2 Permutations and Combinations

### Definitions

1. An arrangment of `n` objects is called a **permutation** of the objects. An arrandment of `r` objects out of a collection of `n` distinct objects (where `n >= r`) is called an **r-permutation of n objects**.  We use the notation P(n, r) to represent a permutation.  We read these as _n permute r_ or _n arrange r_.

2. A collection of `r` objects taken from `n` distinct objects without regaurd to the order of the `r` objects is an **r-combination of the n objects**.  We is the notation C(n, r) for a combination.  We read this as _n choose r_.
