# Final Exam Review

## Exam 1

C control flow (if, if/else, switch, for, while)
 Functions (prototypes, definition, parameters, return type)
 Variables and types (examples: int, char, double, int *, char *, int **, etc.)
 Arrays
 Structs
 Typedef
 Malloc, free, sizeof (allocating
memory on the heap)
 Pointers (to variables, to structs, to arrays, etc.)
 NULL, dereferencing pointers, dangling pointers, pointer arithmetic
 Preprocessor directives
 Printing to console (stdout)
 Reading data from keyboard (stdin)
 File I/O (reading from text files, writing to text files)
 Identifying when a segmentation would occur
 Identifying syntax errors
 Good programming style

## Exam 2

 make and makefiles
 gdb
 Complexity and O-notation
 Linear search
 Binary search
 Prime numbers (looking for divisors, sieve of Eratosthenes)
 Recursive functions (examples: palindrome, gdb, multiply, printing numbers in different bases)
 Arrays for data storage
 Linked Lists, Circular Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists
 Stacks
 Queues

## Exam 3

 Dictionary ADT
 Trees
o Traversals (pre-order, post-order, in-order)
o Terminology, such as
parent, child, leaf, root, descendant, ancestor, height
o Applications of trees
 Binary Search Trees
o insertion
o deletion
o finding items (find value, find min, find max)
 Tree Rotations and Balancing
 Sorting
o Selection sort
o Insertion sort
o Quicksort
o Merge sort
o Complexity of sorting routines
 Graphs
o Searches
 Depth-first search
 Breadth-first search
o Terminology, such as vertex, edge, directed, undirected, degree, predecessor, successor, connected, acyclic, weighted
o Applications of graphs
o Representations
 Adjacency Matrix
 Adjacency List
o Dijkstra’s algorithm: single source, shortest paths (based on HW 6)
o Topological Sort (posted notes)
o Minimum Spanning Trees
 Kruskal
 Prim (similar to Dijkstra)

## Since exam 3

 MST
o Kruskal
o Prim
 Topological sort
 Dictionary ADT (reprise)
 Hash Functions
 Hash Tables
o insert, delete, find
 Collisions with hash tables
o Open Address Linear Probing
o Open Address Quadratic Probing
o Chaining
o Double Hashing
o Pros/Cons of open address hashing vs. chaining
